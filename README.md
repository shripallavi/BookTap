# BookTap
A mini-project implemented using Java front-end and Oracle database.

In this fast-paced world, many people don’t have the time to go to a bookstore and choose a book. Keeping in mind the current pandemic, we have developed an application to bring the traditional bookstore to your device.
The intention behind this project is to design and implement a platform where multiple users can view different books of various genres, including the book’s summary, author and rating. Users can post their opinions on books they’ve read and give a rating out of 5. They can also like and comment on other users' posts and can view the top trending books based on the genre.
Essentially, this application will simplify the exhausting process of selecting a book to read and help connect bibliophiles.
